=== Bootstrapping

To bootstrap the project, you'll need to define database and email settings in the files:

1. <tt>config/database.yml</tt>
2. <tt>config/email.yml</tt> 
3. <tt>config/recaptcha.rb</tt>
3. <tt>config/banners.rb</tt>

This project now uses bundler to manage gem dependency. Make sure you have bundler installed:

<tt>gem install bundler</tt>

Then, execute the following commands on the project root:

<tt>bundle install</tt>

<tt>rake app:bootstrap</tt>

You may be prompted to install a few extra gems.

=== Deploying

To deploy Tectura to the production server, run:

<tt>cap deploy</tt>

You will be prompted for the server password.
